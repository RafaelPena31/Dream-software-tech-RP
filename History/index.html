            <strong>DST - Dream Space Technology</strong><br>
            Rafael was a computer programmer and knew some things about software development, but the initial idea of his brand new project was to have a team of programmers working for him. With that, he would work normally during the day and only guide the team for the next day, but in practice, it was not like that, he did not get investors.
            One day, Rafael met with his friend Gabriel Ziller and ended up putting the idea of the company in conversation, making him interested in helping Rafael in the creation of the company, making them invite some colleagues to manage the other sectors.
            This is Dream Space Technology, distributing the best software solutions for you, always.
